Insert a node at a specific position in a linked list

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insert-a-node-at-a-specific-position-in-a-linked-list/problem
Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, an integer to add to the list and the position at which the integer must be inserted. Create a new node with the given integer, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node.

A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

As an example, if your list starts as  and you want to insert a node at position  with , your new list should be 

Function Description Complete the function insertNodeAtPosition in the editor below. It must return a reference to the head node of your finished list.

insertNodeAtPosition has the following parameters:

head: a SinglyLinkedListNode pointer to the head of the list
data: an integer value to insert as data in your new node
position: an integer position to insert the new node, zero based indexing

function insertNodeAtPosition(head, data, position) {
    let currHead = head;
    let prevNode = head;
    if(position === 0){ 
        head = new SinglyLinkedListNode(data);
        head.next = currHead;
        return head;
    }
 
    let counter = 0; //counter to position insert
    while (counter < position){ //traverse
        prevNode = currHead;
        currHead = currHead.next;
        counter++;
    }
    let newData = new SinglyLinkedListNode(data)
    prevNode.next = newData;
    newData.next = currHead;
    return head;
